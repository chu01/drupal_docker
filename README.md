## Running containers

Our development environment will consists of two containers. One running apache+php and another one for mysql. 

```
$ docker-compose up --build -d
```

### Drush

Drush is installed on the webserver container. In order run drush comman use:

```
docker exec -it web drush Command 
```

### Drupal Project Installation 

The next step is to get drupal project to be part of your repository. For fresh drupal installation please run the script provided. This repo is being shipped with Drupal 8.5.5 under docroot directory. 

```
bash InstallDrupal.sh //this will remove the existing Drupal installation and pull a new 8.5.5 release 
#Please refer https://www.drupal.org/node/3060/release ton install diffrent version of drupal and change the 
#URL on InstallDrupal.sh file to point to the version you want to install.
```
Or 

To dockerize an exixsting project please download the project to this directory and rename it to docroot. 
It is remmended to restart the web container after anychange to a volumen directory. 

‚ùóDuring installation if an error "Can't unlink already-existing object" occured. Please try removing the docroot directory as a root user (sudo rm -rf docroot/) and rerun this script.  

 ** Also if an existing Project is docorized please make sure drush is part of the project or run :

```
cd docroot/ && composer require 'drush/drush'
```
### Vendor Directory 

Vendor directory is ignored in our repository. So, please run composer install to get Drupal dependecies


```
cd docroot/ && composer install 
```


### Now go to the URL below to intall Drupal on your container


From now on we use a normal Drupal Intallation, 

```
Open: http://localhost:HOST_APACHE_PORT (The port number you configured on .env file)
```

During installation on database configuratuion open the advanced setting to change the database host to MYSQL_NAME configured on .env file
